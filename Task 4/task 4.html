        <h2>1. Semantic Elements</h2>
        <p>HTML5 introduced a set of semantic elements that provide better structure to web documents. One key example is the &lt;header&gt; element, which defines a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links. Other semantic elements include &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;.</p>

        <h2>2. Video and Audio Support</h2>
        <p>HTML5 includes built-in support for embedding video and audio content directly into web pages without the need for third-party plugins like Flash. This is achieved using the &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; elements. These elements offer compatibility with various media formats and provide easy-to-use playback controls.</p>

        <h2>3. Canvas for Graphics</h2>
        <p>The &lt;canvas&gt; element in HTML5 allows developers to draw and manipulate graphics, charts, and animations directly within the browser using JavaScript. It provides a powerful and versatile way to create interactive visual content, such as games, data visualizations, and image editing applications.</p>
    </section>

    <footer>
        <p>These are just a few of the many features that HTML5 brings to web development. HTML5 enhances the structure, multimedia capabilities, and interactivity of web pages, making it a fundamental technology for modern web development.</p>
